%\section{Abstract for the application}
%
%Artificial intelligence (AI) with big data is a promising technology to solve several
%seemingly unrelated problems, such as object recognition in images used for
%fruit sorting or obstacle detection in self-driving cars, voice recognition and
%natural language processing used in smartphones, or diagnostics in health car.
%Some applications of AI will be in embedded systems where resources are
%constraint and result must be delivered within a given deadline.
%
%The proposed project targets development of AI for embedded real-time systems,
%which includes also ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) devices.
%We target the AI based classification in the embedded devices with timing constraints.
%As main technology for classification we will use artificial neural networks (ANN).
%Training is usually not associated with time constraints and we envision that
%the training is performed in the cloud, and not in the embedded device.

\section{From InfinIT}

Digital systems are already an integral part of our life. These systems are built out of microprocessors, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Several companies in Denmark are building digital systems. To increase competitivity of those companies, we need tools and methods to increase the productivity in designing and especially testing digital systems. Compared to software development and testing, digital design and testing methods and tools lack several decades of development. Within this project we plan to leverage software development and testing methods for digital design. This project explores the hardware construction language Chisel with Scala and the Universal Verification Method (UVM) with SystemVerilog for design and test of digital systems.



UVM is becoming an industry standard for design verification. On the other hand there is an active development on a new hardware construction language, called Chisel. Chisel is embedded in Scala to write so-called hardware generators. Chisel is also called: software defined hardware. Another feature of the Chisel/Scala combination is to write models of the environment of the hardware design in Scala. As an example take a network interface (e.g., Ethernet) written as a high-level model in Scala connected to a microprocessor written in Chisel. With this example we are able to develop and test network code on the microprocessor, which is our digital design under test.



As a first step we will explore and compare the two approaches: UVM/SystemVerilog and Chisel/Scala. When we generate hardware from Chisel, we generate a Verilog description of the digital circuit. This Verilog description can further be tested within UVM (plain Verilog is valid SystemVerilog). As a next step, we will explore how test, simulation, and verification code written in Scala to develop the Chisel description of the digital circuit can be reused at the UVM level to test the generated Verilog description of the circuit.


Modern software techniques can be applied on testing where plausible. For example, fuzzing is a mature solution for producing random and yet meaningful inputs to trigger program failures. Symbolic execution explores program paths systematically via constraint solving.



We are in contact with the developers of Chisel at the University of California in Berkeley, and especially with Richard Lin, who is developing the new testing framework for Chisel. Richard is interested in this project and the integration with UVM. Therefore, we agreed to have a cooperation meeting during the project at UC Berkeley.



The project fits into the Infinit topic of IoT. The things of IoT are digital systems, often small and application specific systems. Application specific systems are built out of digital systems either with a dedicated ASIC or an FPGA.



This mini-project will be executed in close cooperation with Microchip, WSA, Synopsys, and Syosil. 



The students involved in the research project well then be well educated future engineers for digital system design and verification.

\section{Introduction and Objectives -- A Start}
\label{sec:objectives}

We cannot longer depend on Moor's Law to increase computing performance~\cite{dark-silicon:2011}.
Performance increase with general-purpose processors came to a halt.
The only way to achieve higher performance or lower energy consumption
is by building domain-specific hardware accelerators~\cite{domain-hw-acc:2020}.
Furthermore, the production of a chip is very expensive. Therefore, it is important to get the design right
at the first tape-out. Throughout testing and verification of the design is mandatory.

To efficient develop and verify those accelerators we can learn from software development trends
such as agile software development~\cite{agile:manifesto}.
We need agile hardware development~\cite{henn-patt:turing:2019}.

Until a few years, the two main design languages Verilog and VHDL dominated the
design and testing of digital circuits. However, both languages are decades behind
modern languages for software development.

Resent advances with SystemVerilog and Chisel bring object-oriented programming
into the digital design and verification process. SystemVerilog, as an extension of Verilog,
adds object-oriented concepts for the non-synthesizable verification code.
Chisel is a language, embedded in Scala, to describe digital circuits.
Circuits described in Chisel can be tested and verified with a Chisel testing
framework and tests written in Scala.
Scala/Chisel brings object-oriented and functional programming into the world of
digital design.

This project proposes a research project that aims at building a testing framework
in Scala that takes the best methods from UVM and from decades of experience
in software testing.
Furthermore, our aim is to build on open-source projects only. Therefore, our
work is in open-source as well.


\section{Background and State-of-the-Art}
\label{sec:background}


\subsection{Hardware Verification}




%%%ZF
\subsection{Software Testing Methods}
Testing is crucial for making software reliable. The higher
expectation of software quality and shrinking development cycle have
driven programming language researchers and software engineers to
develop a spectrum of \emph{automated testing} techniques. For example,
Continuous Integration~\cite{duvall2007continuous} implements an agile
method based on expert-written unit tests. It runs the tests
automatically during software evolution to avoid regression.  However, continuous integration automates only execution
of tests, not their generation. To deal with the later,
state-of-the-art automated testing research addresses
the following two challenges.


\paragraph{Challenge 1.}
The first challenge is how to determine the expected code behavior, or
called \emph{specification}.  Software developers document such
specification or encode them within the software in the form of a
contract. \emph{Property-based testing} provides a convenient way in
formulating specification as constraints expressed in a
domain-specific language~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ClaessenH00}.  For
example, developers in Scala can specify a property, such as $n^2>0$
for all integers, in the property-based testing library
ScalaCheck~\cite{nilsson2014scalacheck} as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
val propSquare = forAll {(n: Int) => n * n > 0}
\end{lstlisting}

Another way to generate specification is to use \emph{sanitizers} in
compilers. Sanitizers are a common compiler feature that automatically
injects run-time checks to capture certain failure
conditions~\cite{DBLP:conf/usenix/SerebryanyBPV12}. For example,
Google's undefined behavior sanitizer UBSAN checks whether a
floating-point variable equals 0 before a division by it; Google's
address sanitizer ASAN targets illegal memory access. While sanitizers
do not deal with functional correctness as unit tests do, they check
low-level, sometimes security-related properties, such as
use-after-free, array-index-out-of-bound, or race conditions.

\paragraph{Challenge 2}
The other challenge is how to generate interesting tests inputs.  The
state-of-the-practice  uses
\emph{fuzzing}~\cite{takanen2018fuzzing}. Property-based testing~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ClaessenH00},
for example, uses random data generation, a form of plain fuzzing.  By
invoking {\tt propSquare.check} on a with ScalaCheck, where {\tt
  propSquare} is the constraint of $n^2>0$ defined above, we can
immediate get an input that falsifies the constraint:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
scala> propSquare.check
       ! Falsified after 1 passed tests.
      > ARG_0: 0
      > ARG_0_ORIGINAL: 1083860448
\end{lstlisting}
 ScalaCheck first finds that n = 1083860448 produces an overflow
 wrapped to a negative (thus $n^2>0$ fails). The input is then
 "shrunk" (in the terminology of property-based testing) to a smaller
 one, 0 in this case.  Modern fuzzers can be more efficient by
 including a feedback loop to improve their randomly generated
 data. For example, they monitor runtime statistics and improve input
 data by optimizing code
 coverage~\cite{DBLP:journals/tse/BohmePR19,DBLP:conf/pldi/FuS17}.






\section{Research Plan}


%%%ZF
Our workpackages (WPs) follow.
\subsection{WP1} 
As a starting point, we will use ScalaCheck, an implementation of
property-based testing in Scala, for hardware testing. We will invite
hardware developers to write properties as constraints (like
propSquare above), and then we will use ScalaCheck to validate those
constraints. Property-based testing has seen notable
successes previously, such as locating a long-standing concurrency bug
in the Erlang database server; it was also used by Volvo to test car
communications protocols~\cite{DBLP:conf/icse/HughesNSA16}.

\paragraph{MS1.} The milestone in this WP is to have a empirical study on the effectiveness of our approach. In particular,  we will consider testing on two kinds of properties. The first kind is injected faults, of which we will measure our capability in detecting the faults. Another category is the expected code behavior, of which our approach should  pass without raising  warnings. 

\subsection{WP2} 
We can then consider to generate specification automatically, \`a la
sanitizers used in the compiler techniques. This WP focuses on
low-level properties derived from the program syntax, {\em, e.g.},
accessing an array should be within a bound, or performing an
arithmetic calculation should not overflow.



\paragraph{MS2.} The milestone in this WP is to develop a program transformer
that injects in the software source, or its binary form, a list of
low-level specifications.

Related to this WP, our project collaborator Zhoulai Fu (together with
a hired security hacker) used sanitizers to find more than 200 bugs in
the Robot Operating System
(ROS)~\cite{web:ros-sanitizer-logs}. Besides, Zhoulai Fu has developed
several program transformers previously for testing floating-point
computation~\cite{DBLP:conf/pldi/FuS19,DBLP:conf/oopsla/FuBS15}.


\subsection{WP3}   we will also  consider to generate specification from  previous known bug patterns.  We will collaborate with our hardware engineers to explore a
history of hardware issues triggered by software defects, and get
patterns from winch we generate specification. Such patterns will be
similar to those in the widely used pattern-based software analysis
tools such as FindBug~\cite{DBLP:conf/paste/AyewahPMPZ07} or
Scalafix~\cite{web:scalafix}. Some examples of the bug patterns in
java can be found in \cite{web:findbugs_bugs}. Compared with WP2, this
step will  generate specification in a syntax-driven way, but
unlike sanitizers, it will produce a different kind that  relates
to expected functional behavior of the hardware.

%Related to this WP3, Zhoulai Fu worked on a project, "Historical bug
%patterns in robot operating system" where the purpose was to find new
%bugs by learning from historical ones.



\paragraph{MS3.} The milestone for WP3 is a database of bug patterns. Similar to MS2,
a program transformer will be implemented to convert the bug patterns
into code specification. The generated specification for our benchmark
should be validated by our hardware developers, with which a refinement
step can be introduced to improve the database.


Related to this WP, our collaborator Zhoulai Fu has worked on a comprehensive study of developing bug finders by learning from history bug patterns in the Robot Operating System~\cite{nielsenFSW2020dependencybugs} .



\subsection{WP4} Once we have tools to instrument the software under test with user-written
specification (as in WP1) or automatically generated specification (as
in WP3 and WP4), we will be in a position of using fuzzing techniques
to validate those specifications. To this end, we will need to work
with our industrial collaborators to get access to driver programs
that runs the software under test. 

\paragraph{MS4.} The milestone in this WP is to have a list of bugs reported, and a detailed case study (whether the bugs are
trivial, false alarms, for example) Besides, coverage statistics will  be
collected to measure comprehensiveness of our tests. 

\subsection{WP5} We plan to deploy our automated testing solution  in a continuous
integration service, presumably on the cloud, such as Jenkins or
Travis~\cite{DBLP:journals/tse/GallabaM20}. For each code commit, the
service will automatically generate the specification as implemented
in WP2 and WP3, and then will generate test data with a fuzzing engine
as in WP4.

\paragraph{MS5.} The milestone is to have the server established that implements
the workflow. It should produce a detailed status report for each
commit.  A similar kind of status report can be found in Google's
OSS-Fuzz (Continuous Fuzzing for Open Source
Software)~\cite{web:oss-fuzz} for example.


\paragraph*{Dissemination and Publication}

Scientific results will be published and presented at international
conferences (DATE, ...) and in relevant scientific journals.
We expect that most tasks will result in at least one publication.
One PhD theses will publish the results from the project.
We aim to publish in open access, to a large extent in the gold open access model.
However, publishers such as ACM also allow publishing in green open access
at no additional cost, where a pre-print version of a paper can be uploaded,
for example, to ArXiv.

The results from the project will be available as open-source under the
industry-friendly BSD license.
%Open-source research projects attract
%other researchers, developers, and industrial partners
%to use and build on the results of the project.
A project web site will host the project documentation, the published papers, and the
source code of the design.



\section{Practical Feasibility}

%The Embedded Systems Engineering section at DTU Compute provides
%the intellectual environment and the infrastructure (e.g., regression test server...) that we need for an ambitious research project.
%Furthermore, DTU Compute provides the infrastructure (e.g., an automatic test
%environment for regressions tests, web server).

\paragraph*{Internationalization}



\paragraph*{Industrial Cooperation}



\paragraph*{Human Resources}

For the SDH project we
request funding of the PhD student (NN) and postdoc (???).
Each of the senior researchers will contribute to the SDH research project.

%We intend to build a group with one PhD student, one postdoc, and
%two senior researchers at DTU.

%Quoted from the Diversity and Gender statement at DTU:
%``Diversity, equal treatment, and equality are integral to DTU, being an international
%university in scope and standard, and are fundamental principles underlying DTU's
%expectations of respect and equality''.
As the already named researchers are all male, we will actively search
for a female researcher for the PhD position.
However, the PhD position will be announced openly and men and women
will have equal opportunities for applying.


  {\bf Martin Schoeberl (MS)} is associate professor at DTU Compute and is the PI.
   His research interest is in computer architecture for real-time systems. During his work at Coin,
   he has developed an ANN system to detect different welding parts using
   properties, such as area, circumference, and momentum, for classification.
   Martin has worked on bringing machine learning to an embedded Java processor~\cite{pedersen:2006-64}, including a multicore
