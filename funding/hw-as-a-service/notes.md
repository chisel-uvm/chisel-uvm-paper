The title is "Hardware as a Service".

The project addresses the following: (1) how to make hardware accelerates in the cloud accessible for SW developers, (2) how HW verification can learn from SW testing, and (3) co-verification of SW and HW with modern tooling. The project requests funding for two PhD students and is together with ITU.

 * Lead: Martin Schoeberl (DTU), Zhoulai Fu (ITU)
 * WS6, WS7
 * Core partners: DTU, ITU
 * External partners: TBD, invitation email is sent out


## Note:

 * There is some good text on co-verification in the ftp-chisel folder as a Word document from ?
 * Accelerators are needed for AI and krypto stuff
